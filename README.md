# Personal Website - Next.js Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website where I'm experimenting with modern web technologies including React, Next.js, JavaScript, and CSS. Built as a learning project to explore responsive design, interactive animations, and modern frontend development practices.

## About This Project

This website serves as both a personal portfolio and a hands-on learning experience with:
- **React** - For building interactive user interfaces
- **Next.js** - For server-side rendering and optimized performance
- **JavaScript** - For dynamic functionality and user interactions
- **CSS/Tailwind** - For modern, responsive styling and animations

The project demonstrates my growing skills in web development while showcasing my professional background, education, and upcoming projects.
